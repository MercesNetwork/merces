## Concepts:

DNS : (Domain Name Service) it register and keep ownership link between web DOMAIN and Public Key
Example:

|   Domain            |        Publickey        |
| :------------------ | :---------------------- |
|   mercestoken.com   |        XXXX         |
|   facebook.com      |       YYYY         |


When claiming a domain you can manager UNS in your scope


UNS : (User Name Service) it register and keep ownership link between User of a Domain and its Public Key
Example: in 'mercestoken.com' scope

|   Username   |        Publickey  |
| :----------- | :-------------------------| 
|   Alice 	 |        AAAAAAAA       |
|   Bob		  |	      BBBBBBBB       |


As a user you delegate rights to one PublicKey. Then the Publickey signing transactions can get back money sent to the Account

## Example of process:
* any-social-media.com     : HEY I am any-social-media.com  
* Bob (on the website)     : HEY I am Bob I delegate rights to PublicKey BBBB  
* Alice (on the website)   : HEY I am Alice I delegate rights to PublicKey AAAA  
* AAAA (on Merces Network) : HEY transfer X token to 'Bob' being user of 'any-social-media.com'  
* BBBB (on Merces Network) : HEY get back all my money I got on 'Bob' of 'any-social-mecia.com'
